// words vs keywords 

// keywords are special words that have a special meaning in a language

// words are random words 

// variables are used to store values in a program
// it is made just to use the data stored in memory for reuse in the same program in the future for further execution of the program 

// let var const 

// const no value change 
// let and var 
// var old way of declaring variables in js 
// let is the new way of declaring variables in js

//  var, let, and const â€“ Line-by-Line Comparison

// var = es5 feature 
// let , const = es6 feature

// var let const 
a = 12; // global scoped variable , not block scoped , should not be practiced in modern js
var a ; // declared (undefined due to hoisting to top of scope of variable declared )
var a = 12 ; // initialized 
var a = 13; // reinitialized or can say redclared also 
a = 13 ; // reassigned 
let a ; // declared 
let a = 12; // initialized 
a = 13 ; // reassigned
let a = 13 ; 
// const a ;
// const a ;  error because const can't be declared and left for later reinitialization 
// const variables are to be declared and initialized at the same time along with no access to reassignment of values which is allowed in let and var 
const a = 12;
